SyncSecurePlus is a Minecraft plugin designed to integrate multiple Discord bots with your server. The project is currently under development with plans to inspect and add more features.

## Features

## Installation

1. Download the SyncSecurePlus plugin jar file.
2. Place the jar file in the `plugins` directory of your Minecraft server.
3. Start your server to generate the default configuration files for SyncSecurePlus.
4. Configure the plugin using the generated configuration files.

## Configuration
